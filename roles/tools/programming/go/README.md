Go
========

Ansible role that installs [Go](https://golang.org/). The latest stable release that has been compiled for x86 64-bit Linux systems is installed by default, and different platforms and versions are supported by modifying the role variables.

Role Variables
--------------

All of these variables are optional and should only be changed if you need to install a different version of Go (e.g. if you are installing on FreeBSD, or if you need to use an earlier release).

`go_tarball`: The tarball that you want to install. A list of options can be found on the [Go Downloads page](https://golang.org/dl/). The default is the official x86 64-bit Linux tarball for the latest stable release.

`go_tarball_checksum`: This variable specifies the algorithm and checksum for the tarball that you want to install (e.g. `sha1:c7d78ba4df574b5f9a9bb5d17505f40c4d89b81c` or `sha256:a96cce8ce43a9bf9b2a4c7d470bc7ee0cb00410da815980681c8353218dcf146`). The default is the SHA256 checksum of the official x86 64-bit tarball for the latest stable release. Checksums can be found on the [Go Download Page](https://golang.org/dl/).

`go_version_target`: The string that the `go version` command is expected to return (e.g. "go version go1.2.1 linux/amd64"). This variable is used to control whether or not the Go tarball should be extracted, thereby upgrading (or downgrading) a previously installed copy. If the installed version already matches the target, the extraction step is skipped.

`go.download_location`: The full download URL. This variable simply appends the `go_tarball` variable onto the Go Download URL. This should not need to be modified.

`set_go_path`: Whether or not to set the GOPATH for all users. The default is `true`.
